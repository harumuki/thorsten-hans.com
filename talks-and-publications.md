I'm actively contributing to different technology communities for more than a decade now. My contributions reach from articles for print and online developer magazines over meetups and user-groups to talks and workshops for the biggest international developer conferences.

*The best knowledge is worth nothing if it's kept secret.*

## Talks

With more than **300** public talks on software development related topics, it's tough to keep a list of all sessions and workshops up-to-date. Instead, I'd like to share my highlights. An unsorted list of conferences, I was able to contribute to:

### Commercial Conferences


 * SharePoint Conferences Las Vegas
 * TechED North America
 * European SharePoint, Office365 and Azure Conference
 * BASTA!
 * API Summit / MicroServices Summit / DotNet Summit
