[*iTerm2*](https://www.iterm2.com/){:target="_blank"} is a real productivity boost for *macOS* users. There are numerous great features built in the terminal replacement. This article will explain how to configure the *hotkey window* *iTerm* is offering.

Over the past couple of weeks, I found myself using *Ubuntu* quiet often. Unfortunately, *iTerm2* isn't available for *Ubuntu*, but there is *Guake* which is another powerful terminal. The experience and integration *Guake* is offering for *Linux* distributions is amazing, *Guake* registers a global shortcut to easily open the terminal no matter where you're currently working on.

The terminal instance slides down from the top of the screen and automatically receives the focus. Besides the nice integration, it's also amazingly fast because the so-called **Hotkey Window** keeps it's session alive. *iTerm2 Hotkey Window* is another great capability to increase your daily developer productivity. So you should check it out and give it a try, it's worth it.

Open *iTerm2* preferences using `CMD+`, and navigate to *KEYS*. In the bottom left corner all settings related to the *HOTKEY WINDOW* can be found. There is also a short video which demonstrates the entire configuration and even some more tweaks when it comes to Hotkey Windows.
