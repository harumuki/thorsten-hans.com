## The idea

Most developers frequently create new projects, either for work or for just trying something new. This is also true for me. I found myself using yeoman to create new projects almost every day automatically. There are plenty of great generators available in the wild. Just visit the [yeoman website](http://yeoman.io) and discover the generator repository, itâ€™s fantastic.

Iâ€™ve also built several public and internal generators to generate `gulpfiles` for every new project. However, if you rely on (almost) the same stack for many projects, it makes no sense to maintain all those `gulpfiles` for every project. This makes just no sense!

At that point I started thinking about **Build as a Dependency** or you may also call it **Build as a Service (BaaS)**.

Technically we will package our existing build into an npm package and publish it on [NPM](http://www.npmjs.com), so we can quickly consume the full-fledged build directly from there and donâ€™t have to repeat yourself for every project.

## Implement theÂ BaaS

To keep things clean, Iâ€™ve created a new repo which will only host our build scripts. You can find the new repo [here](https://github.com/ThorstenHans/xplatform-build).

When discovering the project, you may realize that there is no additional code in that repo. Itâ€™s just the gulpfile, and all the contents from the `gulptasks` directory also with its own `package.json`. When building this an npm package, itâ€™s important to set `main` within `package.json` to `src/gulpfile.js`.

The entire build is publicly available on NPM with the name `xplatform-build`.

## Refactoring x-note

Integrating **xplatform-build** in x-note is pretty simple.

First, refactor the package.json file to look like shown below.

```json
{
  "name": "x-note",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "",
  "main": "gulpfile.js",
  "author": "Thorsten Hans <thorsten.hans@gmail.com> (https://thorsten-hans.com)",
  "license": "MIT",
  "devDependencies": {
    "gulp": "^3.9.0",
    "xplatform-build": "^1.0.1"
  }
}

```

After doing so, move to the terminal and execute

```bash
# clean all installed local modules first  (optional)
rm -rf node_modules

npm install xplatform-build --save-dev

```

## Modify x-note

**Delete** the entire `gulptasks` directory. Then open `gulpfile.js` and replace the **entire content** with the following line of code.

```javascript
require('xplatform-build');
```

## Give it aÂ try

Move to the terminal and try our gulp tasks as shown below.

```bash
gulp
# which will automatically execute gulp help

gulp build
gulp build:mobile
gulp build:desktop

```
Thatâ€™s awesome.Â ðŸ˜€

## Updated x-note onÂ github

You can find the version of x-note on GitHub within a [**dedicated BaaS branch** over here](https://github.com/ThorstenHans/x-note/tree/baas).
