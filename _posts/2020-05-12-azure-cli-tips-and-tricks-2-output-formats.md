Azure CLI Tips & Tricks is a collection of small, yet powerful things, that will boost your productivity when working with Microsoft Azure CLI.

`az find` is a useful command for every Azure CLI user. It is the go-to command if you want to get scenario-based examples for Azure CLI commands. You provide any Azure CLI command as positional argument to `az find` and it will scan the official Azure documentation for examples.

You want to see examples of 1st level sub-commands like `aks`? Just type `az find "az aks"`.
You want to see more specific samples? Go ahead and execute `az find "az aks update"`.

Although you can look at the full help of any command by appending `--help` or just `-h`, `as find` is more focused and presents you a bunch of sample commands based on typical day-to-day scenarios.
