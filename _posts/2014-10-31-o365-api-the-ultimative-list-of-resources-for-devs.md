Finding information targeting the latest Office 365 API builds can be a hard job, that’s why Chaks  -  he's one of the Program Managers at Microsoft who’s currently working on the O365 API Tools  —  has summarized an impressive list with all critical resources.

If you’re new to Office365 development and don’t know where to get started, I advise you to read at least this post [http://chakkaradeep.com/index.php/the-ultimate-link-roll-for-getting-started-with-office-365-apis](http://chakkaradeep.com/index.php/the-ultimate-link-roll-for-getting-started-with-office-365-apis){:target="_blank"}

On top of that, he’s frequently blogging great articles on O365 and sharing examples on those APIs.
