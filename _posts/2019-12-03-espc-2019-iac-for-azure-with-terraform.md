This week European SharePoint and Azure Conference (ESPC19) takes place in Prague. I had the chance to give a talk on Terraform as part of the Azure track.

My talk was all about adopting Infrastructure as Code (IaC) in the Azure space.

During the talk we built three different environments (development, staging and production) with slightly different configuration. If you want to look at the final solution, [checkout the demo-code on GitHub](https://github.com/ThorstenHans/espc2019-terraform){:target="_blank"}.

Additionally, you can cycle through my slidedeck right here.
