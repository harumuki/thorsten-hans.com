Every one of us knows about those situations. You ship your app to production and you’re instantly losing 10 pounds of weight 💪🏼 if nothing bad happens in the first 24 hours. You’re finally able to get some sleep, customers are happy, the manager is happy, *you are happy*!

But at some point in time your app will crash! It will definitely crash. No matter how professional you are, there are bugs! Customers will find them! And that’s **okay**.

We’ve tools and technologies to patch our software easily. We can deliver updates through stores or using plain `HTTP` in combination with third-party libraries to instantly update an app which is already installed on a customers device.

It’s **not okay** to trust in your strength and the robustness of your app for 100% without expecting that some bugs may happen. *Don’t be that naive*. Use proper mechanisms to measure what’s going on. Mechanisms like Microsoft’s AppInsight and of course Electron’s built-in *CrashReporter*.

## Electron  -  CrashReporter

*CrashReporter* will send unexpected, occurred at runtime to a remote Server using either `HTTP` or `HTTPS`.

Electron’s *CrashReporter* is an implementation of [Crashpad](https://chromium.googlesource.com/crashpad/crashpad/+/master/README.md), a powerful crash-reporting engine. Crashpad has been integrated into Google Chromium for macOS back in March 2015 and replaced the previous library called Breakpad. **Breakpad, on the other hand, is still being used for Electron on Windows and Linux**. That’s important as you’ll notice in a few seconds.

Setting up *CrashReporter* inside of an Electron app is frictionless. It’s just a simple function call with some metadata that belongs to the **main process**. You should initialize *CrashReporter* **as early as possible** in your app’s lifecycle.

```javascript
const { app, BrowserWindow, crashReporter } = require(‘electron’);

crashReporter.start({
 productName: ‘TaskApp’,
 companyName: ‘xPlatform.rocks’,
 submitURL: ‘http://localhost:3000/api/app-crashes'
 uploadToServer: true
});

```

That’s all for Windows and Linux!

## macOS additions
As already mentioned is Electron using *Crashpad* instead of *Breakpad* as the foundation when executing an app on macOS. That said, you’ve to start the *CrashReporter* explicitly in both process (*main* and *renderer*).

So you should add the following snippet to the *renderer process*.

```javascript
const crashReporter = require(‘electron’).crashReporter;

crashReporter.start({
 productName: ‘TaskApp’,
 companyName: ‘xPlatform.rocks’,
 submitURL: ‘http://localhost:3000/api/app-crashes'
 uploadToServer: true
});

```

> This code is for demonstration purpose, in your real implementation you’ll, of course, get rid of the duplicated code.

## Hint for Angular developers

If you’re writing your web app based on *Angular*, you should [check out ngx-electron](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ngx-electron), a small library which makes consuming *Electron APIs* in *TypeScript* and *Angular* frictionless.

## The server-side
There are already two open source projects that you can use to get the server-side API up and running:

 * [mini-breakpad-server](https://github.com/electron/mini-breakpad-server)
 * [socorro](https://github.com/mozilla/socorro)

If you want to get it up and running in no time, go and take one of these. Personally, I prefer integrating the server-side logic into the project’s API over having a second, dedicated API.

The following sample demonstrates how to implement the server-side API using Node.js and Express.

### Setup the API

If you’ve already a working express API, you can skip these steps, but ensure that you’ve installed `multer` package in addition to `express` itself.

```bash
mkdir node-api

yarn init

yarn add express — save
yarn add multer — save

touch index.js

```

### The express API implementation
The implementation is pretty much, straight forward. *CrashReporter* will send any crash as `POST` request to the defined API endpoint (here `http://localhost:3000/api/app-crashes`). It’s a `multipart/form-data` message, containing a dump file and the following metadata:

```json
{ 
  _companyName: ‘xPlatform.rocks’,
  _productName: ‘TaskApp’,
  _version: ‘0.1.1’,
  guid: ‘e47569a7-da27–4632–9bf8–1cef7f8b44b9’,
  platform: ‘darwin’,
  process_type: ‘renderer’,
  prod: ‘Electron’,
  ver: ‘1.4.15’ 
}

```

You can also add custom metadata, according to the official docs, only string properties are sent successfully to the API endpoint.

```javascript
const express = require(‘express’),
  multer = require(‘multer’),
  bodyParser = require(‘body-parser’),
  path = require(‘path’),
  fs = require(‘fs’),
  http = require(‘http’),
  miniDumpsPath = path.join(__dirname, ‘app-crashes’);

const app = express(),
  server = http.createServer(app);

let upload = multer({
  dest: miniDumpsPath
}).single(‘upload_file_minidump’);

app.post(‘/api/app-crash’, upload, (req, res) => {
  req.body.filename = req.file.filename
  const crashData = JSON.stringify(req.body);
  fs.writeFile(req.file.path + ‘.json’, crashData, (e) => {
    if (e){
      return console.error(‘Cant write: ‘ +  e.message);
    }
    console.info(‘crash written to file:\n\t’ + crashData);
  })
  res.end();
});

server.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log(‘running on port 3000’);
});

```

The `multer` package does a great job in dealing with `multipart/form-data` requests. Everything else is pretty self-explaining. 

This API is just taking all the metadata and writes it to a dedicated file. The created file will have the same name as the `minidump`, but it’ll have the `.json` extension. Both files were written to the subfolder `app-crashes`.

Start the API from the terminal using `node index.js`.

## Testing CrashReporter

You can easily test your CrashReporter setup using `process.crash()` from both processes like shown in the following figure.

title="Electron CrashReporter in Action!" caption="Electron CrashReporter in Action!" %}

From this point in time you’ll receive important information about unexpected app crashes 💣 from all your electron app instances. In combination with the dump file, it’s easier to reproduce what happened and less time consuming to find and eliminate bugs 🚀.
