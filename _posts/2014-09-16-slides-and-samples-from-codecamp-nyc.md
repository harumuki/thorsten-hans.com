On Saturday I spoke at CodeCamp in New York. It has been the third CodeCamp NYC in a row for me. I like the community event in New York because I’m able to combine both, holding a session and visiting one of the greatest cities in the states.

Finally, I got a talk which wasn't related to SharePoint 🙂 “ASP.NET MVC ❤ AngularJS.”

Most of the tips and hints I gave during this talk came from real-world customer projects which were built using that technology stack with only a few SharePoint integration points 🙂 So I could focus on the Angular and MVC WebAPI stuff.

The samples are available on GitHub located in my [conferences repository](https://github.com/ThorstenHans/Conferences/tree/master/2014_CodeCampNYC){:target="_blank"}

If you have further questions to this talk feel free to reach out.
