This week, API Summit 2019 took place in Berlin. I was invited to demontrate some Infrastructure as Code (IaC) goodness and talk about Terraform. 

During my half-day tutorial, I explained how to create multi-cloud infrastructures for Azure and AWS using HashiCorp Terraform. Additionally, we used `git flow` to establish a proper collaboration workflow.

All samples are available [on GitHub](https://github.com/ThorstenHans/api-summit-2019-terraform){:target="_blank"}.

Additionally, you can cycle through my slidedeck right here.
