The biggest and best conference about SharePoint, Microsoft’s SharePoint Conference takes again place in Las Vegas from 3rd till 6th of March 2014. I’m glad to announce that Experts Inside delivers two sessions next year in Vegas.

To see the entire list of session check out the #SPC14 website at [http://www.sharepointconference.com/content/sessions](http://www.sharepointconference.com/content/sessions){:target="_blank"} Within an in-depth dive developer session I’ll explain how to speed up your App Development for SharePoint using API abstractions. In detail, I’ll show the benefits of my Open-Source-Framework ShareCoffee and how you can take the best benefits from using such frameworks.

My fellow MVP [Nicki Borell](http://www.sharepointtalk.net/){:target="_blank"} will also deliver a session. He’s going to talk about SharePoint’s web analytics features and how you can get valuable information using Microsoft’s BI tools. There is also be a short development part of this talk where I’ll demonstrate how to aggregate this data from a development perspective and how to build analytics dashboards.

See you in Vegas.
