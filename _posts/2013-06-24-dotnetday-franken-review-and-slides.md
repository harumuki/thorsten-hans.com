About a week ago I did a presentation on SharePoint’s new App Model to give developers a rough introduction into the new age of SharePoint development.

*.NET Day Franken*  - one of the coolest german community conferences  - was celebrated for the 4th time in Nürnberg Germany. It was also the 4th time that I was invited as a speaker, so it’s great to see how the conference is growing and becoming a must-join event for every community member in Germany.

If you’re interested in my talk about SharePoint’s new App model, visit the conference site over [here](http://www.dotnet-day-franken.de/){:target="_blank"} and grab a copy of my slides. As mentioned earlier it was more introduction into SharePoint’s App model, and the new APIs SharePoint is offering for developers.

Hopefully, I’ll be invited for the upcoming .NET Day Franken in 2014 to show the latest news from the SharePoint world to the German .NET community
