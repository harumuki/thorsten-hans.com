My fellow MVP [Damir Dobric](https://www.linkedin.com/in/damir-dobric-a2756286/){:target="_blank"} organizes the local Azure Meetup in Frankfurt. We know each other for many years and meet several times a year at different conferences. Back in September 2019, we met in Mainz during BASTA! 2019 and decided to do a local Meetup in Frankfurt and talk about Terraform in the context of Microsoft Azure. Due to the global impact of Coronavirus, we decided to transform the meetup into a virtual meetup.

That said, we also decided to do the meetup in English to address a broader audience. The meetup is free and will take place on Thursday the 16th of April 2020 at 18:00 CEST. You can register for free using [the official meetup event page](https://www.meetup.com/de-DE/Azure-Meetup-Frankfurt/events/269521359/){:target="_blank"}.
