Yesterday I only posted a short post about the most recent release of Office 365 API Tools.

I had the chance to get some hands-on since yesterday and the most important thing youâ€™ll see when using the GA Release maybe, that there is no longer a `CalendarApiSample`, `MailApiSample` or similar sample class for accessing resources from Office 365.

There are some reasons why those samples are gone, but for developers starting with Office 365, itâ€™s a little bit harder right now to get started.

Microsoft and especially the PG behind those APIâ€™s itâ€™s doing a great job and investigating much time to provide proper documentation with lots of samples.

**Documentation**Â ðŸ™‚ is a problematic story at Microsoft, the quality of documentation is different for every product. In the past years, we saw terrible docs from various teams driving developers crazy to get anything working as expected. Azure and OneNote division are doing the best job across the entire Corp in my eyes. However, the team around those O365 APIs is catching up.

There is also a *free to use API Sandbox* available right now. You can use the sandbox to play around and get started with the APIs. [http://buff.ly/1wyQBiH](http://buff.ly/1wyQBiH){:target="_blank"}

[dev.office.com](http://dev.office.com){:target="_blank"} is still one of the most important links you should bookmark and visit frequently regarding API documentation, recent news, samples or use cases for all *Office Development* stuffâ€Šâ€”â€Šincluding Office 365 APIS.

A kind of new documentation for Office 365 APIs is available at [http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/office/office365/howto/common-mail-tasks-client-library](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/office/office365/howto/common-mail-tasks-client-library){:target="_blank"}, where youâ€™ll find a ton of source-code samples regarding all the features Office 365 API is offering including the entire authentication process using Azure AD. *So this is the place to get started* for you right now.

As Iâ€™ve said at the beginning, the team did a great job right here, and Iâ€™m looking forward to getting my fingers on those APIs in more detail during the upcoming weeks.
