The Microsoft MVP Mentor Program is offering free learning resources for students presented or created by Microsoft MVPs. Yesterday I’d the chance to do a webinar on SharePoint App Development using JavaScript.

The webinar was in German, but I’ve created the slides in English to provide a value for a broader audience. If you’re interested in a rough introduction into building SharePoint Apps check out my slide deck.

I’m currently trying to manage the second run of this webinar in English. As soon as the recording of my session is available on Youtube, I’ll update this post and also embed the recording itself. As mentioned earlier, this is an introductory session which will explain to you the very basics of building Apps for SharePoint using client-side technologies and call into SharePoint’s APIs (CSOM and REST).
