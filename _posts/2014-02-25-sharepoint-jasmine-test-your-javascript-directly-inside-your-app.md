Today Iâ€™ve published SharePoint.Jasmine on [GitHub](https://github.com/ThorstenHans/SharePoint.Jasmine){:target="_blank"} and [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/SharePoint.Jasmine/){:target="_blank"} which allows you to test your JavaScript code directly inside of a SharePoint App. By installing SharePoint.Jasmine into your project using

`Install-Package SharePoint.Jasmine`

All required artifacts for executing JavaScript UnitTests using [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/){:target="_blank"} are automatically integrated into your App project. The updated App structure will look like the following

Most important is the actual test page located in `Pages/tests`

The `index.aspx` file is responsible for loading the Jasmine Test-Runner, the specs and all the JavaScript source files youâ€™re interested in. By default, Iâ€™ve added the Jasmine-Sample folder which gives you a rough introduction in how to write JavaScript unit tests using Jasmine. When installing the App and navigating to the Test-Runner-Site, youâ€™ll receive the test results embedded in the default SharePoint MasterPage.

Keep on testing your codeÂ ðŸ™‚
