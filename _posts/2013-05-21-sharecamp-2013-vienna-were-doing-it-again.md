I’m thrilled to announce that we’re organizing another ShareCamp. After participating in the successful fourth edition of our ShareCamp in Munich, we’re now going to add more ShareCamps in different venues.

The upcoming ShareCamp will take place in Microsoft Austria’s headquarter in Vienna on 9th of September. Save the date and visit our [ShareCamp Austria site](http://www.sharecamp.at){:target="_blank"} and sign in. 

Registration opens now, and we’re currently limited to 75 attendees. So, hurry up and register for the 5th ShareCamp. As every time, attending a ShareCamp is free. We’re also scheduling a ShareCamp Party on Saturday evening. As soon as new information about the party is available, I’ll keep you updated. I want to say thank you to the entire organization-crew, without the great orga-team it would be impossible to schedule such an event.

So, thank you for making this event happening.

A big thank you also goes to our Sponsors, they are supporting us, and they’re also responsible for making ShareCamps possible

As you can see, the list of sponsors isn’t that huge yet. If you like our idea and the ShareCamp label, please feel free and contact anyone of us (orga crew) and we can talk about becoming a ShareCamp sponsor.
