We are getting closer to the European Azure and SharePoint Conference 2019 (ESPC2019), which takes place during December 2019 in Prague.

A couple of speakers (all focussing Azure related topics) and myself agreed on delivering a vast amount of free content to ramp up your Azure skills before ESPC19.

We will celebrate Azure week starting the 14th of October and have a [great schedule](https://www.sharepointeurope.com/azure-week/){:target="_blank"}  for you.  

I will contribute a webinar about Terraform and Azure on Friday the 18th of October at 11 am CEST. You can [register for the webinar here](https://www.sharepointeurope.com/azure-week/#form){:target="_blank"}.

During the webinar, I will guide you through the concepts of Infrastructure as Code and Terraform itself, followed by some live demos in the context of Terraform and Azure.

I hope many of you will join the webinar to learn more about Terraform and Infrastructure as Code.
