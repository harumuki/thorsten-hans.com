As every year, SPC14 was a blast. It was amazing to connect with all the guys and girls from the SharePoint world. During this post, I’m not going to summarize the SPC, so this post is only providing the content from my talk (#SPC417). First and most important are the demos.

## Demos

All my demos are available for free on GitHub, so go and check out [https://github.com/ThorstenHans/SPC417](https://github.com/ThorstenHans/SPC417){:target="_blank"}, regarding ShareCoffee in common, you should check out the ShareCoffee landing page at [https://sharecoffee.github.io](https://sharecoffee.github.io){:target="_blank"}

## Slides

I’ve published my slides on SpeakerDeck at [https://thns.io/slides](https://thns.io/slides){:target="_blank"}.

Recording

As for all sessions during #SPC14, there is also a video recording from my talk available on Channel9.

Thanks again to all the attendees for joining my session. I know that’s hard to decide during #SPC which talk you should go for. Therefore it’s even more important to watch the recordings from all sessions and rate the sessions. For us, as speakers, it’s essential to get feedback to improve our presentation skills over time.
