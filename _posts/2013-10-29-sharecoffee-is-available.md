Iâ€™ve published ShareCoffee today [on GitHub](http://github.com/ThorstenHans/ShareCoffee){:target="_blank"}. ShareCoffee is a small library containing cool stuff for SharePoint App developers. ShareCoffee is entirely written in CoffeeScript using the test-driven-design approach with (Mocha, ChaiJS, and SinonJS). Since the SharePoint App model is available, I thought about writing this library, but within the last four days I sat down and created it!Â ðŸ™‚

ShareCoffee is offering all the stuff I was faced with since I started App development for SharePoint. The goal was for me to create a library which provides a single programming interface for any SharePoint App. What is ShareCoffee offering ShareCoffee is offering various functionality which Iâ€™ve grouped into the following `namespaces`:

- ShareCoffee.Commons
- ShareCoffee.UI
- ShareCoffee.REST
- ShareCoffee.CSOM
- ShareCoffee.CrossDomain

In this post Iâ€™m explaining how to install ShareCoffee in your project and the functionality offered by `ShareCoffee.Commons` and `ShareCoffee.UI`

## Wiki and Samples on GitHub

There are also a bunch of samples on GitHub in [a dedicated repository](https://github.com/ThorstenHans/ShareCoffee.Samples){:target="_blank"}, And the entire API is documented within the [WIKI on GitHub](https://github.com/ThorstenHans/ShareCoffee/wiki){:target="_blank"}

## Installing ShareCoffee

You can install ShareCoffee by copying the JavaScript library from the repository to your project, which will work but itâ€™s quite dirty. Itâ€™s a better approach to install ShareCoffee from `NuGet` or `bower.io` using the following commands

### NuGet

```powershell
Install-Package ShareCoffee

```

### Bower.IO

```bash

bower install ShareCoffe

```

After the sources have been included in your project, you have to add a script reference to your SharePoint App WebSite, and youâ€™re ready to go. When writing JavaScripts, you can enable basic IntelliSense using the reference syntax in VisualStudio by adding the following line to your JavaScript file

```javascript
/// <reference path="sharecoffee/sharecoffee.js" />

```

### ShareCoffee.Commons

The commons are everyday helpers such as

- `ShareCoffee.Commons.getQueryString()`
- `ShareCoffee.Commons.getQueryStringParameter(parameterName)`
- `ShareCoffee.Commons.getFormDigest()`
- `ShareCoffee.Commons.getAppWebUrl()`
- `ShareCoffee.Commons.getHostWebUrl()`
- `ShareCoffee.Commons.getApiRootUrl()`

Most of the methods should be self-explaining, but `getAppWebUrl()` and `getHostWebUrl()` offer some great functionality. For both methods you can define custom load methods, which will be invoked to load this data from your custom storage (Database, Cookie, â€¦)  `getAppWebUrl` looks for `_spPageContextInfo`, if `_spPageContextInfo` is not present, it checks the URL for the `SPAppWebUrl` parameter. For both methods, the custom load functions have the highest priority, which means that if you pass a custom load function, `getAppWebUrl` and `getHostWebUrl` will only call these. You can set the custom load function for `getAppWebUrl` as shown here:


```javascript
var appWebUrl = ShareCoffee.Commons.getAppWebUrl();
// looks within _spPageContext if present
// looks within the QueryString for SPAppWebUrl

ShareCoffee.Commons.loadAppWebUrlFrom = function(){
  return "https://my-appweb-url/";
};

appWebUrl = ShareCoffee.Commons.getAppWebUrl();
// will only invoke ShareCoffee.Commons.loadAppWebUrlFrom()

```

### ShareCoffee.UI

`ShareCoffee.UI` is offering various functions for interacting with SharePointâ€™s UI. The most powerful method is of course `ShareCoffee.UI.loadAppChrome(chrome settings);` which does the whole SharePoint-App-Chome loading stuff for you! The following Sample shows how `loadAppChrome` is configured.

```javascript
  var chromeSettings = new ShareCoffee.ChromeSettings("", "My AutoHosted SharePoint App",
    new ShareCoffee.SettingsLink("foo.html", "Foo", true),
    new ShareCoffee.SettingsLink("bar.html", "Bar", true)
  );
  
  var onAppChromeLoaded = function () {
    console.log("chrome should be loaded now!");
  };
  
  ShareCoffee.UI.loadAppChrome("chrome-placeholder-id", chromeSettings, onAppChromeLoaded);

```

#### Other methods in ShareCoffee.UI

- `ShareCoffee.UI.showNotification()`
- `ShareCoffee.UI.removeNotification()`
- `ShareCoffee.UI.showStatus()`
- `ShareCoffee.UI.setStatusColor()`
- `ShareCoffee.UI.removeStatus()`
- `ShareCoffee.UI.removeAllStatus()`

See notification samples here.

```javascript
// showNotification(message, isSticky = false)
// isSticky defaults to false
ShareCoffee.UI.showNotification("My notification");

var stickyNotificationId = ShareCoffee.UI.showNotification("My sticky notification", true);

ShareCoffee.UI.removeNotification(stickyNotificationId);

```

Moreover, status samples here.

```javascript
var lastStatusId = null;
 
// showStatus(title, contentAsHtml, showOnTop = false, color = 'blue');
//use defaults for showOnTop (false) and color (blue)
lastStatusId = ShareCoffee.UI.showStatus("Status Title", "ShareCoffee <b>Status</b>"); 

// show status on top
lastStatusId = ShareCoffee.UI.showStatus("Status Title", "ShareCoffee <b>Status</b> displayed on top", true);
 
ShareCoffee.UI.setStatusColor(lastStatusId, 'red');
ShareCoffee.UI.setStatusColor(lastStatusId, 'yellow');
ShareCoffee.UI.setStatusColor(lastStatusId, 'blue');
 
// removeStatus will not be forwarded to SharePoint is statusId is null or undefined
ShareCoffee.UI.removeStatus(lastStatusId);
ShareCoffee.UI.removeAllStatus();
 
```

### Whatâ€™s next

Within the next post on ShareCoffee, Iâ€™ll explain how to work with the `ShareCoffe.REST` namespace!

Happy Scripting.
