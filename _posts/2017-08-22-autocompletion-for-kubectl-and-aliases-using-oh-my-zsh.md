*Kubernetes* is managed and used by utilizing the command line interface `kubectl`. I got a ton of questions regarding my terminal configuration for daily k8s tasks. Questions like *‚ÄúWhich aliases do you use for regular k8s tasks?‚Äù* or *‚ÄúHow did you get autocompletion for all the k8s stuff up and running on your mac?‚Äù* 
So this post will answer those questions quickly to ensure everyone will become more productive and can spin up even more pods and nodes in less time üöÄ

## Create an kubectl alias

`kubectl` is an amazing CLI. There is only one disadvantage, the name. I can‚Äôt recall how many times my terminal was saying

```bash
zsh: command not found: kuberclt
# or
zsh: command not found: kubctl

```

Or referring to any of the other 1000 typos. Thankfully each and every shell can deal with aliases. No matter if you use *bash* or *oh-my-zsh*, the configuration syntax for aliases is dead simple and consistent across most important shells. Simply add the following line to your `.zshrc` or `.bashrc` file.

```bash
alias k="kubectl"

```

Restart the terminal or source the config file `source ~/.zshrc` and you‚Äôre done. You can access `kubectl` by simply hitting `k`.

## Enable autocompletion for kubectl

Enabling autocompletion for `kubectl` heavily depends on the shell you‚Äôre using. To be honest, I don‚Äôt know if each shell is able to provide autocompletion for `kubectl`. That‚Äôs the point when *oh-my-zsh* enters the stage. That shell is awesome, easy to configure and it has a minimal *time-to-code*.

*time-to-code* is a term that describes the time you spent from unboxing your shiny new notebook till writing the first line of code or executing the first command in this case. (hopefully, neither [Andrew Connell](https://twitter.com/andrewconnell) nor [Chris Johnson](https://twitter.com/c_f_johnson) have a trademark for that term).

Once you‚Äôve [installed *oh-my-zsh*](http://ohmyz.sh/)üòÉ, you can easily enable the **kubectl** plugin by adding `kubectl` to the list of plugins in your `.zshrc`. That should look similar to this:

```bash
# somewhere in your zshrc
plugins=(git git-flow brew history node npm kubectl)

```

That‚Äôs it. Nothing more is required. *oh-my-zsh* does all the magic for you. Autocompletion will work for both: `kubectl` and the recently created alias `k`.

Having this configuration in place, you'll gain more speed when working with *Kubernetes* and you'll produce less typos!
