During SharePoint Conference 2014 in Las Vegas, I bought a Dell Venue 8 Pro because I was looking for a small device in addition to my Surface Pro and my 15‚Äù MacBook Pro.

## Here my most essential requirements

- Long battery lifetime
- Running Windows 8 Pro
- Having access to all my essential services like‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäMultiple Exchange Accounts
- OneDrive
- OneDrive for Business
- Windows Azure
- The device should be rechargeable easily

At this point, I‚Äôd like to say thank you to my good old friend Heino, who pointed me to Dell‚Äôs device and gave me the chance to play a little bit with his Venue 8 Pro during SPC14.

Summarising the first weeks with my Dell Venue 8 Pro isn‚Äôt a complicated task. It‚Äôs just amazing. The small device is supporting me in different scenarios. For example, I use it instead of my Kindle to read books. I use it during business meetings to take notes using OneNote.

As you can see in picture one, the screen resolution is fantastic. Taking notes (of course with an external keyboard) is excellent. The display has high contrast.

From the hardware perspective, I like the camera which produces excellent pictures with its 5 MP lens. Also, the fact that the Windows Button is located at the side of the device is excellent and turned out to be more natural as the location which my Surface is providing.

The most critical aspect is the battery lifetime. When doing daily Office work, battery life is roughly about 8.5 hours. So I can use my device during a day-long meeting. That‚Äôs cool.

I love it.
