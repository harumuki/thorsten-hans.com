For developing native web languages I use SublimeText 2 ([http://www.sublimetext.com/](http://www.sublimetext.com/)). Like many other editors, SublimeText offers a great plugin ecosystem, which allows you as a developer to add various functionality by installing additional packages.

Within this post Iâ€™ll introduce some plugins Iâ€™m using to increase my developer performance.

## Package Control

Package Control is the most robust and vital plugin; it allows you to add new plugins to sublime without typing endless commands into the console or manually copying files to the application directory. To install Package Control, youâ€™ve to execute the following script from Sublime Textâ€™s Console

```python
import urllib2,os; pf='Package Control.sublime-package'; ipp=sublime.installed_packages_path(); os.makedirs(ipp) if not os.path.exists(ipp) else None; urllib2.install_opener(urllib2.build_opener(urllib2.ProxyHandler())); open(os.path.join(ipp,pf),'wb').write(urllib2.urlopen( 'http://sublime.wbond.net/'+pf.replace(' ','%20')).read()); print 'Please restart Sublime Text to finish installation'

```

## Emmet

Emmet (previously known as Zen Coding) is excellent for creating HTML elements because youâ€™re typing a kind of CSS Selector style statements and Emmet is automatically creating the corresponding HTML for you.

## JavaScript Minifier

Crunch your JavaScript files by using Google Closure Compiler (`CTRL` + `ALT` + `m`)

## Tag

`Tag` is excellent for developers writing much declarative code. It will automatically add closing tags when you write the opening one.

## Search Stackoverflow

Instant StackOverflow Search Plugin. But-SaverÂ ðŸ˜‰

## Git

Adds Git support to Sublime Text including built-in Diff Viewer. This plugin is one of the best time savers for me.

## CoffeeScript

Allows you to write CoffeeScript in Sublime Text and offers features like

- Syntax Highlighting
- Snippets
- Assertions

## CoffeeCompile

Compile your CoffeeScript file directly from within SublimeText 2 [`CTRL` + `SHIFT` + `C`]

## Node.js

Allows you to write Node.js in SublimeText and offers features like

- Syntax Highlighting
- Snippets
- Assertions

### nodejsLauncher

Launch your Node.JS file directly from the editor [`CTRL` + `ALT` + `n` + `r`]

## Summary

There are of course plenty more good plugins available for SublimeText. These are just a few plugins I use frequently.

Is there an essential plugin missing, do you use a plugin that should be listed here? Leave a comment and share your knowledge with the community.
