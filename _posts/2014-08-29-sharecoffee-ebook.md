About a week ago I finally published my first eBook on [LeanPub](http://www.leanpub.com){:target="_blank"}.

The book covers all the different ShareCoffee features and describes how to use them within SharePoint App projects. On about 100 pages all the different capabilities are explained and demonstrated using small code-snippets.

There is also a short SharePoint App introduction included if youâ€™re not familiar with the SharePoint App platform. Leanpub is offering a flexible pricing model. So usually the minimal price for my eBook is $9.99 but based on a two-week poll the suggested price has been locked at $10.99 (but itâ€™s entirely up to you how much you spend).

Publishing an update is easy on leanpub, and you - as a reader - will automatically be notified about the new version. That's also the main reason why I prefer *LeanPub over Amazon as self-publishing platform*. My promise to all the readers is that Iâ€™ll keep on updating the book and improving all the chapters currently offered.

There is a special community offer for all readers of my blog. You can grab a copy from my book right now with a *minimum price of $7.99* but you can, of course, spend some more bucks.Â ðŸ™‚

Fun fact: Two Java Chip FrappuccinosÂ® at [Starbucks](http://www.starbucks.com){:target="_blank"} are even more expensiveÂ ðŸ™‚
