I am thrilled to join the announcement of the European Azure Conference 2020 (EAC20). While Microsoft just finished celebrating the 10th birthday of Azure, we want to add another reason to be excited about Azure.

From **2nd till 4th of June 2020**, Azure enthusiasts from all over the world will meet in beautiful **Nice** (France) to celebrate the first iteration of this independent and dedicated Azure conference in Europe.

During the three-day event, we will deliver outstanding Keynotes, **8 tutorials**, and **more than 70 sessions** covering all areas of Microsoft Azure.
