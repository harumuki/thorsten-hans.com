On September the 7th the first **ShareCamp** in Vienna was celebrated by Austrian SharePoint Community. About 60 SharePoint addicted people came to Vienna, to spend a Saturday in Microsoft Austria's HQ.

Traditionally the ShareCamp was opened with the session building. Within 30 minutes the attendees formed the entire conference schedule with round about 25 sessions.

The sessions were covering different topics from SharePoint Migration to App Development and from Windows 8 in Enterprises to SkyDrive. Audience discussions popping up during the talks was exciting. Both Speakers and Attendees discussed various topics directly in the session. This is one essential aspect of BarCamps.

I love this kind of open discussions, and in my eyes, this should be forced for the next ShareCamp in Germany. At this point, I would like to say a big thank you to the entire Austrian crew, that make this event happen. Administrating and organizing such an event remotely will not work. Therefore a vast Thank you guys and girlsÂ ðŸ™‚

A ShareCamp wouldnâ€™t be a ShareCamp without a traditional party. All campers have the chance to talk about the topics theyâ€™ve seen in the sessions, make new connections to other partners, customers, ISVâ€™s or end users.

At this point, Iâ€™d like to say thank you again to all Sponsors. Also a big thank you to Microsoft Austria for sponsoring this fantastic location and to the entire organization team. Hopefully, weâ€™ll see rising more and more ShareCamps.

If youâ€™re interested in holding a ShareCamp, shoot me a mail.
