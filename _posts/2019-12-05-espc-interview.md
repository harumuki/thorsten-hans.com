[Fabian Williams](https://twitter.com/fabianwilliams){:target="_blank"} (fellow MVP and good friend of mine) interviewed me during [European SharePoint, Office365 and Azure Conference (ESPC19)](http://sharepointeurope.com/){:target="_blank"}. We had a great conversation about different topics which I focus on these days. Basically, we talked about

- Microsoft Azure
- Infrastructure as Code
- Engagement in the developer community
- How to participate and contribute to the community

Additionally, we talked about how ESPC has evolved over time and how it addresses latest and greatest technology trends. The interview was filmed and is available for free, in full length on YouTube.
