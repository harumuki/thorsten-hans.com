Building a secured WebAPI using *Azure Active Directory (AAD)* is pretty easy, OWIN middleware allows developers to integrate AuthN in their services quickly.

Accessing those API with plain old C# is easy because *AAD Authentication Library (ADAL)* forÂ .NET is available for quite a long time (at least what we call a long time in our businessÂ :D)

During TechEd Europe, Microsoft announced and released the developer preview for *ADAL.js* â€Šâ€”â€Ša lightweight JavaScript library for integrating AAD authentication into your *Single Page Application (SPA)*.

To get *ADAL.js* working for your AADâ€Š â€ŠApplication, youâ€™ve to *opt-in* for *OAuth2.0 implicit flow* which is currently disabled by default. This setting can only be changed by downloading the application manifest and changing `oauth2AllowImplicitFlow` to `true`, once youâ€™ve uploaded the manifest again, you can use ADAL.JS with your Azure AD Application.

ADAL.JS is available on GitHub, and the community and contributions from the community are more than welcome. [ADAL.js Repository](https://github.com/AzureAD/azure-activedirectory-library-for-js){:target="_blank"}. There is also a working example right here [ADAL.js AngularJS Sample SPA](https://github.com/AzureADSamples/SinglePageApp-DotNet){:target="_blank"}.

When exploring that example, I stumbled upon many bugs and naming issues in AngularJS. However, again,Â ðŸ˜€ after reading their AngularJS code, Iâ€™m 100% sure that Microsoft doesnâ€™t do that much **AngularJS** development.

To fix those bugs and apply a proper naming for all the AngularJS stuff, Iâ€™ve forked the repository and applied my changes theirÂ :).

If youâ€™re interested in the *polished, fixed and readable* version, go and check out my implementation right here [Polished ADAL.js AngularJS Sample](https://github.com/ThorstenHans/SinglePageApp-DotNet){:target="_blank"}

Further readings on *ADAL.js* could be found on Vittorio Bertocciâ€™s [blog](http://www.cloudidentity.com){:target="_blank"}

Iâ€™ve created a pull request, so perhaps my changes will go to the official sampleÂ ðŸ™‚

###Get the Sample up and running

To get the sample up and running you should follow the instructions in [Readme.md](https://github.com/ThorstenHans/SinglePageApp-DotNet/blob/master/README.md){:target="_blank"}. The code currently shows Tenant-Idâ€™s in `web.config` and `app.js` but putting in the primary domain name of your AAD is also fine.
