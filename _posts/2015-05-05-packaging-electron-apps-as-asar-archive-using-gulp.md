 A couple of weeks ago I open-sourced a sample on how to build an electron app using Angular and ES6. The sample has become popular on Github, so I sat down and updated the sample a bit. All changes are about distributing the electron app.

Instead of writing down all the bits, I’ve started Camtasia and recorded a short webcast.

I’ll explain all the required steps from 0 to the final `app.asar` package in these 11 minutes. Enjoy
