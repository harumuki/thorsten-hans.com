As most SharePoint addicted people already may know, [SharePoint Conference 2014](http://sharepointconference.com/){:target="_blank"} takes place in Las Vegas again starting on 3rd March 2014.

So far nothing new, but the conference team has just published the Top 14 sessions. Most interesting for me will be the â€˜Developing on-premises solutions with an eye on the futureâ€™ from the development track.

At Experts Inside weâ€™re currently doing most of our projects within Office 365, but there are still some customers who donâ€™t want to join the cloud. So this session looks promising to me because Iâ€™m often faced with questions like â€˜What will happen if we go for full-trust solutionsâ€™.

Perhaps I can grab some more arguments here for moving customers to the cloud and get rid of all the core infrastructure stuff.Â ðŸ™‚

See you in Vegas again.Â ðŸ™‚
