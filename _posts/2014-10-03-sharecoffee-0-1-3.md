ShareCoffee `0.1.3` is available by now on NuGet and bower. It’s only a small release at this time. Previously I’ve added `ShareCoffee.Commons.infect()` to ShareCoffee as described [here]({% post_url 2014-09-27-sharecoffee-0-1-2 %}).

With `0.1.3` this method got an optional parameter which is very useful for SharePoint Hosted Apps. If you built a SharePoint Hosted App using a plain HTML or ASPX Page, you’ve also to maintain all `a` and `form` tags and ensure that SPHostUrl is part of the QueryString.

So, if you’re building a SharePoint Hosted App, you may use `infect` in the following way.

```javascript
var area = document.getElementById('my-app-container');
ShareCoffee.Commons.infect(area);

```

By providing an element, ShareCoffee will only change `a` and `form` tags within the given element. If you don’t do so, ShareCoffee will `infect` all the `a` and `form` tags on the entire page, which isn’t a good idea for all the SharePoint MasterPage plumbing.

If you’re in a Provider-Hosted App, you can still use it the way released with ShareCoffee `0.1.2`.

```javascript
ShareCoffee.Commons.infect();

```

Go, give ShareCoffee a try and tell me what you like and what you don't like. Feedback is highly welcome and critical to making ShareCoffee even better.
