Today Iâ€™ve published the next AddOn for [ShareCoffee](https://github.com/ThorstenHans/ShareCoffee){:target="_blank"}. ShareCoffee.UserProfiles. Itâ€™s providing a dedicated wrapper for SharePointâ€™s UserProfiles API.

By using the new AddOn, you can easily configure REST requests for dealing with SharePointâ€™s UserProfile REST API from both, SharePoint Hosted and Cloud-Hosted Apps.

## Installation

You can install the AddOn (which will automatically pull ShareCoffee as a dependency) by using.

- NuGet
- bower.io

## Coverage

Not all UserProfile methods are currently available as REST endpoint. Currently, SharePoint is offering the following methods which can, of course, be used with ShareCoffee

- `GetMyProperties`
- `GetProperties`
- `GetUserProfileProperty`
- `SetMyProfilePicture`

## Sample

Here is a short sample on how to use ShareCoffeeâ€™s UserProfiles AddOn from within an AngularJS App written in CoffeeScript:

```coffeescript
window.MyAngularApp.service 'userProfilesService', ['$http', ($http) ->
  loadMyProfile: (onSuccess, onError) ->
    
    $http ShareCoffee.REST.build.read.for.angularJS
      url: ShareCoffee.Url.GetMyProperties
    .success onSuccess
    .error onError
    
  loadProfilePropertiesForUser: (accountName, onSuccess, onError) ->
    properties = new ShareCoffee.UserProfileProperties(ShareCoffee.Url.GetUserProfileProperty, accountName, 'WorkEmail')
    $http ShareCoffee.REST.build.read.for.angularJS
      properties
    .success onSuccess
    .error onError

```
