I live in the most beautiful state of the world called Saarland, which is located in the south-west of Germany. I work as a consultant at Thinktecture AG, a German software consultancy.

I focus on cloud-native application architectures using serverless- and container-technologies powered by Microsoft Azure. I am also well known for my experiences and enthusiasm about Infrastructure as a Code, especially in the context of HashiCorp [Terraform](https://thorsten-hans.com/tag/terraform).

There is only limited time for hobbies besides work and my technical contributions. Whenever possible, I enjoy running in the nature, play soccer and do black-white photography using my beautiful Olympus PEN-F.
