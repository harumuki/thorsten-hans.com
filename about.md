Thorsten Hans lives in the most beautiful state of the world, called Saarland in the southwest of Germany. He's working as a consultant at Thinktecture, a German software consultancy.

Thorsten is currently focusing on cloud-native application architectures using serverless- and container-technologies powered by Microsoft Azure. He's also well known for his experiences and enthusiasm about Infrastructure as a Code, especially with HashiCorp's Terraform.

Besides work and community activities is only limited room for spare-time. If possible, Thorsten enjoys running in nature and doing black and white photography with his beautiful Olympus PEN-F.
